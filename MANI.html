<!--    We, the undersigned, are graphic designers, photographers and students who have been brought up in a world in which the techniques and apparatus of advertising have persistently been presented to us as the most lucrative, effective and desirable means of using our talents.

The nightmare of materialism, which has turned the life of the universe into an evil, useless game.

BECAUSE doing/reading/seeing/hearing cool things that validate and challenge us can help us gain the strength and sense of community that we need in order to figure out how bullshit like racism, able-bodieism, ageism, speciesism, classism, thinism, sexism, anti-semitism and heterosexism figures in our own lives.

(12) We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity. Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are based on matter, There is no matter here. Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdictions. (16)

(54) Emerging technologies (e.g. augmented reality, the smartphone, and social media) have broadened the way that designers communicate to include intersensory expressions—visual, aural, somatosensory, gustatory and/or factory components (19) But We will organize to prevent Microsoft and others from pushing through hardware-level monitoring devices that will prevent users from having control of their own machines and their own data. (25)

 
Making repairs is good for the imagination. Using new techniques, tools and materials ushers in possibility rather than dead ends. (35) Failure counts as done. So do mistakes. (36) Design is a fragment of a concrete utopia. (57)  Design has genuine potential to deliver value, meaning, insight, and fun as well as having the potential for a totalitarian control technology that may cause massive problems for the whole of society. (46) 

But every project must be useful and good for the world (47) There's never been a better time to be a designer because there is so much in need of better design. (43) The ecology of human relationships and the potential for producing new codes of behavior, will become one of the great themes for the culture of project and imagination. (13) Respect relationships between spirit and matter. (14)
Finally it is interesting to speculate about how theories of authorship can serve to legitimize marginalized activities like design and how authorial aspirations may actually end up reinforcing certain conservative notions of design production; notions that might actually contradict the stated goals of the budding designer/author. (59) 
It must be communication in its most intense form. (9) The design disciplines must forcefully articulate, make visible and emphasise the design message in order to influence both public and private decision-making. (11) We step on your crystal goblet of typography at the marriage of liberty and design. The delicate crystal goblet of modernism cannot contain the volume and passion of our humanity. (45) We wish you to be persuaded, that success in your art depends almost entirely on your own industry; but the industry which I principally recommend, is not the industry of the hands, but of the mind (48)  All the candy for the human brain — haiku, ringtones, bumper stickers — would be priced like the luxuries that they are. IF YOU want people to read your book, then you have to read books; if you want people to buy your book, then you buy books. Give your attention to the industry of your choice. (37)

Courage, boldness, and rebellion will be the essential elements in our poetry.  (49) The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products are used every day and have an effect on people and their well-being (4)  Do not glorify aesthetics (38) Is the aim of art only to make money and cajole the nice nice bourgeois? (51) Our Art is the friendship between the viewer and our pictures (52) It is a mistake to think that there is just an economical crisis going on. This is first of all a cultural crisis that manifests itself through the economy. Culturally the crisis has started a long time ago, we all saw it coming. Now it is evident to all, since our economic model is also in evident collapsing. We need to think a new world. We need to build new relations between people and things. To do this, we need a new avangard. (55) So that these can be recognised, narrated, historicized, represented (56)
 
Every time you talk, every time you buy something, every time you apply certain principles (conscious or unconscious or whatever), you make a political statement. I really have problems when graphic designers say, 'I'm not into politics,' or, 'Politics bother me,' or, 'I'm not interested in it.' I can’t relate to this way of seeing things (20) It is thoughtful and accommodating; not arrogant or demanding (60) But no designers can excuse themselves from taking responsibility. (21) We have to represent moral and ethical issues relating to depictions of unnecessary violence in the media, especially TV, drugs, and stereotypical representation of women, blacks and other minorities’ (15) Stereotypical portrayals misrepresent all of us and stigmatize those who are the most vulnerable.(17)  We undermine the idea of a mainstream narrative by revealing the understory, the subtext, the overlooked, and the downright unfair. (53) The industry has been white, male, usually middle to upper class, and overwhelmingly heterosexual. As women artists we are in deep revolt against this rotting art just as we are in revolt against the syphilitic political structures that damage us and endanger world peace.

We will glorify war—the world’s only hygiene—militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman. (64) We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity. (16) 

Difference should have a reason. We’re anti nonsense. Avoid arbitrary randomness. (34) Everything we make is functional. (70) We are creatives. Nothing exists until we give it permission to be, and never again will our work be displayed in ganky uninspired portfolios. We are iconic. (71)   Recognise that art is a powerful tool, a language that can be used to enlighten, inform, a guide to action. (63) In the class society of images, cinema takes on the role of a flagship store. In flagship stores high-end products are marketed in an upscale environment. More affordable derivatives of the same images circulate as DVDs, on broadcast television or online, as poor images. (66) Suppose an artist were to release the work directly into a system that depends on reproduction and distribution for its sustenance, a model that encourages contamination, borrowing, stealing, and horizontal blur. The art system usually corrals errant works, but how could it recoup thousands of freely circulating paperbacks? (65) As first world consumers. We have tremendous power. What we collectively choose to buy. Or not to buy. Can change the course of life and history on this planet. (69) It was only because this fusion had already occurred worldwide on the economic and political planes that the world could be declared officially unified. (10) . We have to design now the framework for new ways of life, which are ecologically and economically sound (12)
 
The things that people have made themselves have magic powers. They have hidden meanings that other people can’t see. (26)  imagine, experiment, create, develop and learn (58) We strive to change minds, touch hearts and move markets. Our passion is to transform ideas into realities. (67) Add pleasure to the work itself, which would otherwise be painful and disgustful (7) 
 
We are lovers of type and color, of design and form, of white space and balance. We are fighters, our friend and foe, the vast empty space mocks us every time, but each day we rise to conquer, and fiercely attack it with shapes and forms and ideas that will never sit still we imagine and know not how to stop always dreaming, always thinking climbing higher on a ladder which we both climb and build up at the same time a ladder that started here, by lovers of the craft.
